Overview
This program is designed to facilitate the search for parts listed in an Excel spreadsheet on multiple websites. Specifically, it searches for parts listed in the "Name" column and provides corresponding references by populating the "Reference" column with links when matches are found. The tool is versatile, allowing users to add additional websites for searching if desired.

Features

Customizable: Users can easily add or remove websites based on their preferences or requirements.
